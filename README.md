# PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED AND SOLUTIONS

Chap 1.4
struggled for a little while to see how to get the arguments from the terminal input.
Turned out that the 1st or [0] is given by the name of the program.
option [1] was the one I was after and needed to check (the first of the actual arguments passed)


# OTHER NOTES AND COMMENTS

This project is exciting, working with AI.
I have an interview this week with a company making one also so bet this
will be a good talking point to consider and have worked on.
